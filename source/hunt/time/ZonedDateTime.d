/**
 * A date-time with a time-zone _in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
 * such as {@code 2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00 Europe/Paris}.
 * !(p)
 * {@code ZonedDateTime} is an immutable representation of a date-time with a time-zone.
 * This class stores all date and time fields, to a precision of nanoseconds,
 * and a time-zone, with a zone offset used to handle ambiguous local date-times.
 * For example, the value
 * "2nd October 2007 at 13:45.30.123456789 +02:00 _in the Europe/Paris time-zone"
 * can be stored _in a {@code ZonedDateTime}.
 * !(p)
 * This class handles conversion from the local time-line of {@code LocalDateTime}
 * to the instant time-line of {@code Instant}.
 * The difference between the two time-lines is the offset from UTC/Greenwich,
 * represented by a {@code ZoneOffset}.
 * !(p)
 * Converting between the two time-lines involves calculating the offset using the
 * {@link ZoneRules rules} accessed from the {@code ZoneId}.
 * Obtaining the offset for an instant is simple, as there is exactly one valid
 * offset for each instant. By contrast, obtaining the offset for a local date-time
 * is not straightforward. There are three cases:
 * !(ul)
 * !(li)Normal, with one valid offset. For the vast majority of the year, the normal
 *  case applies, where there is a single valid offset for the local date-time.</li>
 * !(li)Gap, with zero valid offsets. This is when clocks jump forward typically
 *  due to the spring daylight savings change from "winter" to "summer".
 *  In a gap there are local date-time values with no valid offset.</li>
 * !(li)Overlap, with two valid offsets. This is when clocks are set back typically
 *  due to the autumn daylight savings change from "summer" to "winter".
 *  In an overlap there are local date-time values with two valid offsets.</li>
 * </ul>
 * !(p)
 * Any method that converts directly or implicitly from a local date-time to an
 * instant by obtaining the offset has the potential to be complicated.
 * !(p)
 * For Gaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls _in the
 * middle of a Gap, then the resulting zoned date-time will have a local date-time
 * shifted forwards by the length of the Gap, resulting _in a date-time _in the later
 * offset, typically "summer" time.
 * !(p)
 * For Overlaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls _in the
 * middle of an Overlap, then the previous offset will be retained. If there is no
 * previous offset, or the previous offset is invalid, then the earlier offset is
 * used, typically "summer" time.. Two additional methods,
 * {@link #withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap()} and {@link #withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()},
 * help manage the case of an overlap.
 * !(p)
 * In terms of design, this class should be viewed primarily as the combination
 * of a {@code LocalDateTime} and a {@code ZoneId}. The {@code ZoneOffset} is
 * a vital, but secondary, piece of information, used to ensure that the class
 * represents an instant, especially during a daylight savings overlap.
 *
 * !(p)
 * This is a <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>
 * class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
 * ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of
 * {@code ZonedDateTime} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
 * The {@code equals} method should be used for comparisons.
 *
 * @implSpec
 * A {@code ZonedDateTime} holds state equivalent to three separate objects,
 * a {@code LocalDateTime}, a {@code ZoneId} and the resolved {@code ZoneOffset}.
 * The offset and local date-time are used to define an instant when necessary.
 * The zone ID is used to obtain the rules for how and when the offset changes.
 * The offset cannot be freely set, as the zone controls which offsets are valid.
 * !(p)
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
