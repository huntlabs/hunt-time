/**
 * A date without time-of-day or time-zone _in an arbitrary chronology, intended
 * for advanced globalization use cases.
 * !(p)
 * !(b)Most applications should declare method signatures, fields and variables
 * as {@link LocalDate}, not this interface.</b>
 * !(p)
 * A {@code ChronoLocalDate} is the abstract representation of a date where the
 * {@code Chronology chronology}, or calendar system, is pluggable.
 * The date is defined _in terms of fields expressed by {@link TemporalField},
 * where most common implementations are defined _in {@link ChronoField}.
 * The chronology defines how the calendar system operates and the meaning of
 * the standard fields.
 *
 * !(h3)When to use this interface</h3>
 * The design of the API encourages the use of {@code LocalDate} rather than this
 * interface, even _in the case where the application needs to deal with multiple
 * calendar systems.
 * !(p)
 * This concept can seem surprising at first, as the natural way to globalize an
 * application might initially appear to be to abstract the calendar system.
 * However, as explored below, abstracting the calendar system is usually the wrong
 * approach, resulting _in logic errors and hard to find bugs.
 * As such, it should be considered an application-wide architectural decision to choose
 * to use this interface as opposed to {@code LocalDate}.
 *
 * !(h3)Architectural issues to consider</h3>
 * These are some of the points that must be considered before using this interface
 * throughout an application.
 * !(p)
 * 1) Applications using this interface, as opposed to using just {@code LocalDate},
 * face a significantly higher probability of bugs. This is because the calendar system
 * _in use is not known at development time. A key cause of bugs is where the developer
 * applies assumptions from their day-to-day knowledge of the ISO calendar system
 * to code that is intended to deal with any arbitrary calendar system.
 * The section below outlines how those assumptions can cause problems
 * The primary mechanism for reducing this increased risk of bugs is a strong code review process.
 * This should also be considered a extra cost _in maintenance for the lifetime of the code.
 * !(p)
 * 2) This interface does not enforce immutability of implementations.
 * While the implementation notes indicate that all implementations must be immutable
 * there is nothing _in the code or type system to enforce this. Any method declared
 * to accept a {@code ChronoLocalDate} could therefore be passed a poorly or
 * maliciously written mutable implementation.
 * !(p)
 * 3) Applications using this interface  must consider the impact of eras.
 * {@code LocalDate} shields users from the concept of eras, by ensuring that {@code getYear()}
 * returns the proleptic year. That decision ensures that developers can think of
 * {@code LocalDate} instances as consisting of three fields - year, month-of-year and day-of-month.
 * By contrast, users of this interface must think of dates as consisting of four fields -
 * era, year-of-era, month-of-year and day-of-month. The extra era field is frequently
 * forgotten, yet it is of vital importance to dates _in an arbitrary calendar system.
 * For example, _in the Japanese calendar system, the era represents the reign of an Emperor.
 * Whenever one reign ends and another starts, the year-of-era is reset to one.
 * !(p)
 * 4) The only agreed international standard for passing a date between two systems
 * is the ISO-8601 standard which requires the ISO calendar system. Using this interface
 * throughout the application will inevitably lead to the requirement to pass the date
 * across a network or component boundary, requiring an application specific protocol or format.
 * !(p)
 * 5) Long term persistence, such as a database, will almost always only accept dates _in the
 * ISO-8601 calendar system (or the related Julian-Gregorian). Passing around dates _in other
 * calendar systems increases the complications of interacting with persistence.
 * !(p)
 * 6) Most of the time, passing a {@code ChronoLocalDate} throughout an application
 * is unnecessary, as discussed _in the last section below.
 *
 * !(h3)False assumptions causing bugs _in multi-calendar system code</h3>
 * As indicated above, there are many issues to consider when try to use and manipulate a
 * date _in an arbitrary calendar system. These are some of the key issues.
 * !(p)
 * Code that queries the day-of-month and assumes that the value will never be more than
 * 31 is invalid. Some calendar systems have more than 31 days _in some months.
 * !(p)
 * Code that adds 12 months to a date and assumes that a year has been added is invalid.
 * Some calendar systems have a different number of months, such as 13 _in the Coptic or Ethiopic.
 * !(p)
 * Code that adds one month to a date and assumes that the month-of-year value will increase
 * by one or wrap to the next year is invalid. Some calendar systems have a variable number
 * of months _in a year, such as the Hebrew.
 * !(p)
 * Code that adds one month, then adds a second one month and assumes that the day-of-month
 * will remain close to its original value is invalid. Some calendar systems have a large difference
 * between the length of the longest month and the length of the shortest month.
 * For example, the Coptic or Ethiopic have 12 months of 30 days and 1 month of 5 days.
 * !(p)
 * Code that adds seven days and assumes that a week has been added is invalid.
 * Some calendar systems have weeks of other than seven days, such as the French Revolutionary.
 * !(p)
 * Code that assumes that because the year of {@code date1} is greater than the year of {@code date2}
 * then {@code date1} is after {@code date2} is invalid. This is invalid for all calendar systems
 * when referring to the year-of-era, and especially untrue of the Japanese calendar system
 * where the year-of-era restarts with the reign of every new Emperor.
 * !(p)
 * Code that treats month-of-year one and day-of-month one as the start of the year is invalid.
 * Not all calendar systems start the year when the month value is one.
 * !(p)
 * In general, manipulating a date, and even querying a date, is wide open to bugs when the
 * calendar system is unknown at development time. This is why it is essential that code using
 * this interface is subjected to additional code reviews. It is also why an architectural
 * decision to avoid this interface type is usually the correct one.
 *
 * !(h3)Using LocalDate instead</h3>
 * The primary alternative to using this interface throughout your application is as follows.
 * !(ul)
 * !(li)Declare all method signatures referring to dates _in terms of {@code LocalDate}.
 * !(li)Either store the chronology (calendar system) _in the user profile or lookup
 *  the chronology from the user locale
 * !(li)Convert the ISO {@code LocalDate} to and from the user's preferred calendar system during
 *  printing and parsing
 * </ul>
 * This approach treats the problem of globalized calendar systems as a localization issue
 * and confines it to the UI layer. This approach is _in keeping with other localization
 * issues _in the java platform.
 * !(p)
 * As discussed above, performing calculations on a date where the rules of the calendar system
 * are pluggable requires skill and is not recommended.
 * Fortunately, the need to perform calculations on a date _in an arbitrary calendar system
 * is extremely rare. For example, it is highly unlikely that the business rules of a library
 * book rental scheme will allow rentals to be for one month, where meaning of the month
 * is dependent on the user's preferred calendar system.
 * !(p)
 * A key use case for calculations on a date _in an arbitrary calendar system is producing
 * a month-by-month calendar for display and user interaction. Again, this is a UI issue,
 * and use of this interface solely within a few methods of the UI layer may be justified.
 * !(p)
 * In any other part of the system, where a date must be manipulated _in a calendar system
 * other than ISO, the use case will generally specify the calendar system to use.
 * For example, an application may need to calculate the next Islamic or Hebrew holiday
 * which may require manipulating the date.
 * This kind of use case can be handled as follows:
 * !(ul)
 * !(li)start from the ISO {@code LocalDate} being passed to the method
 * !(li)convert the date to the alternate calendar system, which for this use case is known
 *  rather than arbitrary
 * !(li)perform the calculation
 * !(li)convert back to {@code LocalDate}
 * </ul>
 * Developers writing low-level frameworks or libraries should also avoid this interface.
 * Instead, one of the two general purpose access interfaces should be used.
 * Use {@link TemporalAccessor} if read-only access is required, or use {@link Temporal}
 * if read-write access is required.
 *
 * @implSpec
 * This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
 * All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 * Subclasses should be Serializable wherever possible.
 * !(p)
 * Additional calendar systems may be added to the system.
 * See {@link Chronology} for more details.
