/**
 * A date-based amount of time, such as '3 years, 4 months and 5 days' _in an
 * arbitrary chronology, intended for advanced globalization use cases.
 * !(p)
 * This interface models a date-based amount of time _in a calendar system.
 * While most calendar systems use years, months and days, some do not.
 * Therefore, this interface operates solely _in terms of a set of supported
 * units that are defined by the {@code Chronology}.
 * The set of supported units is fixed for a given chronology.
 * The amount of a supported unit may be set to zero.
 * !(p)
 * The period is modeled as a directed amount of time, meaning that individual
 * parts of the period may be negative.
 *
 * @implSpec
 * This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
 * All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 * Subclasses should be Serializable wherever possible.
