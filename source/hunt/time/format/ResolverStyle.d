     * Style to resolve dates and times strictly.

     * be further processed for strictness.
     * !(p)
     * For example, resolving year-month and day-of-month _in the ISO calendar
     * system using strict mode will ensure that the day-of-month is valid
     * for the year-month, rejecting invalid values.

     * Style to resolve dates and times _in a smart, or intelligent, manner.

     * field, which may be the same as strict, the same as lenient, or a third
     * behavior. Individual fields will interpret this differently.
     * !(p)
     * For example, resolving year-month and day-of-month _in the ISO calendar
     * system using smart mode will ensure that the day-of-month is from
     * 1 to 31, converting any value beyond the last valid day-of-month to be
     * the last valid day-of-month.

     * lenient manner. Individual fields will interpret this differently.
     * !(p)
     * For example, lenient mode allows the month _in the ISO calendar system
     * to be outside the range 1 to 12.
     * For example, month 15 is treated as being 3 months after month 12.
